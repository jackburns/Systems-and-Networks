 * CS3600, Spring 2014
 * C Bootcamp, Homework 2, Problem 2
 * (c) 2012 Alan Mislove
 *
 * In this problem, your goal is to learn about C structures.  You will
 * be mananging employee records.  Each employee record consists of 
 * the following values:
 *
 *  - A name string (less than 49 chars long)
 *  - A salary (integer, positive, less than $4B)
 *  - A employee ID (integer, positive, less than 4B)
 *  - A location string (less than 49 chars long)
 *
 * You are guaranteed that there will be no more than 10 employees. You
 * should support 10, and exactly 10, employees.
 *
 * You should do the following:
 * 
 *  - Define an appropriate structure to represent each employee. Call
 *    this structure "struct employee" (surprise!).
 * 
 *  - Define a global location to store the employee records (hint: array).
 *    Be sure to have a way to keep track of which employee records 
 *    are in-use and which are empty.
 *
 *  - Fill in the add_employee, remove_employee, get_salary functions
 *
 * Do not touch anything inside the main() function.
