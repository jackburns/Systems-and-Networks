 *
 * In this problem, your goal is to learn about debugging C programs.
 * Each of the following functions below has an error (often a 
 * segfault).  You should debug and fix each of the functions.  Note
 * that there is likely to be multiple errors in each function.
 *
 * Be sure to not touch anything in the main() function
