CS3600 Project 3 - DNS

Team MostlyHarmless

- Parses input from the console
- Packs parsed input into a byte array packet
- Sends the packet and waits for a response
- Receives a response and unpacks it
- Prints information from response to console

Approach:

As the project is clearly segmented into two clear parts (sending + receiving)
we've implemented the project in such a way that will allow for easily 
expanding into the full implementation. Currently our implementation supports
the first milestone requirements with inclusion of MX and NS server records
that will be fully flushed out on the projects completion.
